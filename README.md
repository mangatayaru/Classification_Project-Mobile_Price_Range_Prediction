# Classification_Project-Mobile_Price_Range_Prediction
In competitive mobile phone market, the companies want to understand sales data of mobile and find the factors that drives the prices of mobiles. In this mobile price prediction dataset, it consists of different features of mobile and price. The data contains information regarding mobile phone features, specifications etc and their price range. The various features and information can be used to predict the price range of a mobile phone. This is multiclassification problem where the price range is between 0 to 3. Firstly the data is cleaned. Secondly, EDA analysis is done to find which factors effect the price of the mobile. After that, in order to make the data ready for machine learning, skewness is verified and transformation is applied everywhere needed to make the data normally distributed. Outliers are found and removed if needed. If these treatments are not applied it results in wrong predictions. The data is scaled equally over all the columns using the different scaling techniques like Standard Scalar, MinmaxScalar etc. Now data is splitted into train and test data with certain ratio and random state. The data is modelled using train data and prediction is done on test data. The different evaluation metrics are applied to check the accuracy of the model and results are compared to find the best model for this mobile price range prediction.
